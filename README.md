# wilson â€“ running and matching beyond the Standard Model

wilson is a Python package for the running and matching of Wilson coefficients of higher-dimensional operators beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. It implements the one-loop running of all dimension-6 operators in the Standard Model Effective Theory (SMEFT), complete tree-level matching onto the weak effective theory (WET) at the electroweak scale, and complete one-loop running of all dimension-6 WET operators in QCD and QED.
